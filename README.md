### **Task Objective**
  Classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning.
### **Dataset used**
  Iris Dataset
  Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width  
  Target: Flower species
### **Model Applied**
  No model applied only visualize the dataset with scatter, box plot, pairplot and histogram
### **Key Results and findings**
    The Setosa class is clearly separable from the other two species based on petal length and width.
    Virginica flowers generally have the largest petal measurements, making them distinct.
    Versicolor overlaps with Virginica but shows moderate petal dimensions.
    Scatter plots and pairplots reveal strong relationships between petal length and petal width.
    Box plots highlight a few outliers and show the distribution differences between species.
