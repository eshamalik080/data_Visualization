# data_Visualization
**Task Objective**
  Classify iris flowers into one of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning.
**Dataset used**
  Iris Dataset
  Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width  
  Target: Flower species
**Model Applied**
  No model applied only visualize the dataset with scatter, box plot, pairplot and histogram
**Key Results and findings**
    Setosa species generally has smaller petal sizes
    Virginica species has the largest petal size
    Scatter plots show clear separation between species
    Box plots reveal outliers in the dataset
